# min-client

A simple client-server setup for quick and dirty development. Includes storing data to a local json file, socket.io to communicate between client-server, and automatically reloads the client when client files change. Only 3 dependencies: express, socket.io and chokidar (for watching client files).

### Install and Run

```
npm install
nodemon server.js
```

Then browse to http://localhost:3000
